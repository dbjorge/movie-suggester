# movie-suggester
A toy go CLI for making movie suggestions from IMDB data. This is a learning exercise to teach myself Go. It is not supported. It is not fully-tested.

## Usage
From a command line/terminal, run:

```bash
movie-suggester
```

It will tell you the path to the config file it is going to use; you can edit that config file to change
how it runs, or delete it to reset it to defaults. You can override config file settings from the
command line; see `movie-suggester --help` for details.
